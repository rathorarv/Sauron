Creating an Orc (Agent)
-----------------------

 - Copy this Basic Orc
 - Rename the directory as your wish
 - Add agent information in config.json file
 ``` 
    {
       "agent": {
         "name": "This Orc(agent) name, ex: Linter, Test-runner"
       }
     }
 ```
 - Set the following env variables
  ``` RABBITMQ_SERVER_URL, RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE, RABBITMQ_ROUTINGKEY, SAURON_REPORTS_URL ```
 - Add any extra dependencies to package.json if you need (Do not delete existing ones) or `npm install dependency-name --save`
 - You can start writing the task in `index.js` inside the promise function 
  ```
    const shell = require("shelljs");
    shell.config.silent = true;

    export default function(data) {
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            // Start coding here....
        });
    }
  ```
 - An argument `data` will be coming through the exporting function
 - It contains the details of the commit that triggered, repository, local downloaded repo directory relative path and the unique Id generated by the Souron (Github Handler)
   ```
     { 
        git: { 
          commit: { 
             id,
             tree_id,
             distinct: ,
             message,
             timestamp,
             url,
             author: {name, email, username},
             committer: {name, email, username},
             added: [],
             removed: [],
             modified: [] },
          repository: { 
             id,
             name,
             full_name,
             description,
             archive_url,
             git_url,
             ssh_url,
             clone_url
          }
        }  
        uniqueId
     }         
   ```
 - Use this unique id for any logging you want to do as part of task execution
    ``` [UniqieID] [System Datetime] Your Log ```
 - To run any shell command from code use shelljs which is already added as dependency      
 - Once the task is done and want to send back the results then just call `resolve` function with the result of the task
 - Catch all the run time exceptions and send it through `reject` function
